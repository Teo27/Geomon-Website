# Geomon-Website

This is the code for the server part as well as the website part of the Geomon project.

In here I was supposed to create a WCF service, which would have both REST and SOAP based services. At first I had a selfhosting server,
but later I was forced to go to azure in order for the android part to work. The communication with the DB is made with procedures so 
that it can provide some extra protection.

The website is made on top of a template together with Bootstrap. It is fully responsive and allows for some good animations. It is not
very dynamic, however. The website was made using the .Net framework, and specifically the ASPs webforms.
